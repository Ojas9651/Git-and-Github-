Git and Github

 

There are more software’s like Apache and Piper but we use Git and Github because 99% companies use this.
Git tracks the changes that you made in your code.
SCM – source control management
VCS – version control system
On CMD –
git - check if git is installed
git -v – check git version

Setup –
 
Why do we setup?
So, every time we made a change in our code, git tracks who made the changes and that is why we need to set the global config.

dir : lists all directories
cd dir-name : change directory
mkdir : makes directory

starting –

git-init – initializes the git in the current directory
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/SONY/Desktop/Coding/git-course/.git/ // output example
As soon as you git init; now U is marked in front of the file
U means – it is untracked ; project is git enabled but untracked
 
A hidden folder will get created named as .git and all the tracking is saved in this folder
Start Tracking –
git add file-name– enable tracking your file
 
Now the symbol changes to A that means additions are tracked
When you save the symbol changes to M
 
git diff – tells what changes are made
 

git add . – to add all files of current folder
git rm file-name – removes the files that from tracking

Commits –
 
So when we start making changes in our code and when we finish making the changes we do commit.
We do following –
git add . – to add all files
git -m commit “Initial Commit” – to commit
 

git log –
 
If we do more changes
Do git add . and then git commit -m “commit name”, then  git log to check all commits

git log –oneline – create the short id for commit
 
git show id – shows what changes are made in that commit
git blame file-name – to check which user made what changes
